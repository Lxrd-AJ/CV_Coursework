\section{Introduction}
This report highlight the different ways the Viola-Jones Haar Cascade Face detection algorithm can be subverted. This is achieved through applying specially orchestrated make-up at designated parts of the face and also wearing clothing which occludes certain aspects of the face whilst still remaining recognisable by a human.

\section{Subverting by applying make-up on the face}
Taking into account the way the Viola-Jones Haar Cascade Face Detection algorithm (referred to as Face Detection algorithm henceforth) works, one can carefully curate features on the face to trick the algorithm into not detecting a face. \\

		\caption{Applying make-up to subvert the algorithm}
		\label{fig:make_up}
	\end{wrapfigure}
One of the ways this is achieved is with the knowledge that the face detection algorithm uses a window where the average intensity of the rectangular window divided into 3 parts with the middle part being the nose and the other windows being the eyes; it expects a darker region on the sections over the eyes than the section over the nose. \\
	
Taking this into account, white face make-up is applied over the eyes and dark face make-up is applied over the nose bridge. With these special effects applied, when the rectangular window slides over the face, this should result in higher intensity values over the eyes and a lower value over the middle section; the algorithm should then misclassify this region. As shown in image \ref{fig:make_up}, there is no bounding box over the face as the algorithm has misclassified this as not a face.


\section{Subverting by partially occluding the face}
The Face detection algorithm takes into account the location of the eyes, nose and mouth.

	\end{wrapfigure}
By partially occluding the face as shown in image \ref{fig:julia}, the algorithm is unable to locate the eyes in the image. 

%%\section{Spoofing Approaches}
%%	\begin{itemize}
%%		\item The eye region is darker than the upper-cheeks. To subvert this try white paint around both eyes; check if it detects a face if eyes are opened and closed. Another approach is to make the upper-checks the same complexion as the eye region although this might be harder.
%%		\item The nose bridge region is brighter than the eyes. Can we try making the nose bridge really dark e.g black paint on the nose bridge.
%%		\item Occlusion: The algorithm takes into account the location of the eyes, nose and mouth. Is it possible to use make-up to blend the skin color around these regions to see if it still detects
